# Building-Controls-and-Optimization
The repository will focus on the investigation of two control methods: an on/off controller and model predictive control (MPC). To do this, two key performance indicators (KPIs) will be assessed when investigating the effectiveness of the two methods. The first KPI is how well the HVAC system remains within a given set of upper and lower temperature bounds. The second KPI is the overall energy usage of the system.
